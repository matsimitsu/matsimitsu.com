		After sleeping in for a bit, I headed out to a nice coffee joint called.. <strong
			>Coffee Joint</strong
		>. The staff was super friendly and the Club Sandwich is amazing, as is the coffee.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next up was the <strong>Acropolis Museum</strong>. You can't bring your bag and while you can
		bring your camera inside, most of the exhibit on the first floor is off-limits for photography,
		so I mainly just lugged the camera around for nothing.

	<h2>The Acropolis.</h2>
	<p>
		Across from the museum is a smaller entrance to the Acropolis, on crowded days it's supposed to
		be less busy. Today, however it wasn't busy at all and there were no queues.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the secondary entrance, the first thing you'll see is the <strong
			>Theatre of Dionysus</strong
		>. A concert theatre with a capacity of 17.000 people at it's prime.

		The Acropolis was a place where the people of Athens worshipped Athena, the Goddess of War. They
		did this by commissioning statues of either Athena or themselves to be put on the mountain. In
		the museum you'll find loads of statues with inscriptions telling who commisioned the statue and
		for what reason (mostly it seemed to be a first large payment of something such as work).
	</p>
	<p>
		It's not just statues though, since Athens was a democracy new laws would also be posted on the
		mountain, and people could put up their own Stele, such as the image above where a priest put up
		a stele which explains his services.

		Next on the trail was the Odeon, a stone Roman theatre built into the slope of the mountain. It
