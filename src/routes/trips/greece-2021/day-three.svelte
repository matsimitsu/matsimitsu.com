	<h2>Plaka</h2>
	<p>
		After getting home around midnight last night I took it a bit easier today and just wandered
		around the city center, eating good food and drinking nice drinks.

	<p>
		While I was taking photos of the church above, these people were riding by. They stopped at the
		statue where the driver explained a few things and then moved on. A pretty neat way to view the

	<h2>Psyri</h2>
	<p>
		Where Plaka is nice and neat, Psyri is a bit more rough around the edges. It used to be a pretty
		shabby neighbourhood, but since the Olympic games in Athens it has been gentrified... mostly.

	<h2>Greek Parliament</h2>
	<p>
		On my way back to the apartment for a quick afternoon refresh (the sun was out in force and it
		was 35 degrees Celcius) I came across the Greek Parliament where guards stood besides the tomb
		of the unknown soldier.

	<h2>Lycabettus Hill</h2>
	<p>
		After a refresh and a delicious Gyros dinner and a few beers I walked a couple of kilometers to
		Lycabettus Hill, just after sunset. It gives a great view of Athens by dawn.
