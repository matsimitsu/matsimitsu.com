		The second attempt at visiting this park, as last Wednesday I had to turn around due to the
		excessive rain, luckily this time it was different.
	</p>
	<p>
		The sun was out in full force, and so where the people. There was a large stream of people
		heading for the entrance. But this park is huge so on the inside it didn&#39;t feel too crowded.

		It&#39;s funny how the main roads are crowded, but as soon as you duck into a small path on the
		site, you&#39;re practically on your own. I spent a good 20 minutes at this lookout and just one
		person came up in that time.
