		After about four hours of sleep it&#39;s time to wake up to catch the tail end of hotel
		breakfast hours. We quickly plan the day ahead, which comes down to, get to the mall to get a
		sweater for Onno (It&#39;s 13 degrees Celcius and his jacket is in his checked bag) and then get
		a taxi/Uber to the city center.

		With only a small queue we chose to do the Basilica Cistern next, for 20 Turkish Lire per person

	<p>
		This complex is completely below ground and only parts are lit up, creating this beautiful view.

		When we got back to the hotel we had an hour to freshen up and upload some (these ;))
		photo&#39;s before the pickup to the airport arrived.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite us missing the flight I have to say the whole process after was really smooth and
		Turkish Airways took really good care by providing the hotels and transfer from/to the airport.
	</p>
	<p>Now we&#39;re waiting for our flight to Biskek to board, which should depart at 21:30.</p>
