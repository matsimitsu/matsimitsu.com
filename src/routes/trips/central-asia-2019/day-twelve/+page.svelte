		The day began great, our hotel neighbour had her birthday and shared delicious cake with us,
		talk about a nice breakfast. We had found a <a

		> that we wanted to try. To get to the start we had to take the metro.

		After visiting the market we had a delicious lunch with traditional Uzbeki food. Pastries filled
		with meat and soup. The shop owner kept bringing more and more food and with some hand gestures
		we managed to convince him we really had enough.

		Around the back (or front, really) is a giant square with a huge Uzbeki flag. People where
		relaxing on the benches and we took a break too, it&#39;s a good ~26 degrees celcius and the sun

		We planned to go to the &quot;Japanese garden&quot; near the &quot;TV Tower&quot; but it was hot

		With a limited budget and not wanting to hit the ATM (and it&#39;s fees) again, we had a simple,

		In-flight dinner with Turkish was delicious again. Everyone always complains about airline food,

		The new airport was open for just a few days, and so far the impression is that taxiing from the
		runway to a gate takes even longer than the dreaded &quot;polderbaan&quot; at Schiphol airport
		and after that you still have to walk a long way to get to your next gate. The airport looked
		great though.
