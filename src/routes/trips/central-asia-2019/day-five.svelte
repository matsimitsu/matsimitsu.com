		Getting quality sleep has been difficult the past few days and today is no different. The alarm
		went at 05:00 and the taxi was waiting at 05:30. This time the fee was an acceptable 15.000 SOM.

		Tashkent Airport has two terminals, the international terminal which is close to the city and
		has nice facilities and the domestic terminal that is... around the back. The style is pretty
		cool though.

		We climbed the &quot;Islam Khoja Minaret&quot; for 15.000 SOM per person. The stairs are steep
		and there is just enough room for someone going the other way to squeeze by. There&#39;s no
		lights, except for a few tiny holes in the wall every now and then. At the top the stairs get
		smaller, not just the steps, but also the height, so watch your head. The view at the top is
		worth it, though!

		Another site not included in the &quot;museum pass&quot; is the &quot;Pakhlavan Mahmud
		Mausoleum&quot;. Pakhlavan Mahmud was a poet, philosopher and wrestler, who apparently never
		lost a fight. Professional Iranian wrestlers still pray to the great Pakhlavan Mahmud before
		every fight today. The entry fee is 10.000 SOM.
