		After the first good night of sleep on the trip we were well rested for today. The plan is to
		wander around Khiva some more untill we have to go to the train station to catch the train to
		Bukhara.
	</p>
	<p>
		We start by getting some snacks for on the train and then make our way to the wall around the
		city. There are a few entry points and none have signs that it&#39;s forbidden to go on the
		wall, so we go :)

		Breakfast was nice, but it&#39;s after noon so time for some lunch. We pick a random place in a
		park near the inner city and get a wrap filled with meat, tomatos and other vegetables. After
		lunch we visit a few other museums in the city.

		and is considered &quot;first class&quot;. Second and third class cabins look the same, but with
		more beds stacked agains the wall.
