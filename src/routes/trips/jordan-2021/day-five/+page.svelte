		The thing most people to Petra for is the first attraction you'll come across after exiting the

	<h2>High place of sacrifice trail</h2>
	<p>
		The park features several trails, and most people take either the High place of sacrifice trail
		that leads you to a viewpoint of almost the entire park or the Al-Khubtha Trail, which leads to
		an outlook of the Treasury.
	</p>
	<p>
		I opted for the High place of sacrifice trail first, as it's an alternative route back to the
		beginning of the park.

	<h2>Al-Khubtha Trail</h2>
	<p>
		With an hour to spare before the park closes, I decided to walk the Al-Khubtha Trail. According
		to the map, it should take 2.5-3 hours. I managed to go there and back again (including a drink)
		in just over an hour.
	</p>
	<p>
		This trail gives you the best view of the Treasury, but it comes at the cost of 2 Dinar for a
		compulsory consumption at the viewpoint. I think the view is worth it, though!
