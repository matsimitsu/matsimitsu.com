		If you've seen the movie Avatar, you probably noticed the giant spikey mountains. Those weren't
		wholly rendered in 3d but shot in Zhangjiajie national park. And today we're visiting those
		mountains.

		The day starts with an hour-long bus ride to the national park. You can see the entrance above.
		Once in the park, you have access to free busses that take you to certain areas. Other
		transportation means such as cable cars and elevators are not free.

		We started by taking the bus to the elevator that takes you right to the top of one of these

		From there, we wander around. Almost none of the signs are in English, and neither are the bus
		destination signs. We have no clue where we are or what direction to go. We did know that we
		paid a ton of money for the elevator, and we didn't want to pay it to get down, so the challenge
		of the day was to find our way back for free.

		Eventually, we figured out that you had to get out of the bus, walk 100 meters to a different
		bus station and get on another bus there. (thanks, Google translate).

		At this point, it was starting to get late, and we were still on top of a mountain with no idea
		how to get down. After asking around, it turned out the fastest way was to get down a hiking
		trail that would take an hour. It turned out it was actually a 3800 step-long set of stairs.
