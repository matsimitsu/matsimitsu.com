		With the alarm set at 07:00 in the morning, this was one of the most challenging days to wake.
		At precisely eight o clock, the driver was waiting in front of our hotel to take us to the boat
		dock for our cruise. While we were in the car, it was still raining and very foggy; we hoped the
		rain would clear up during the day.

		After a Chinese-only safety briefing and a cup of tea, we were allowed to visit the boat's top
