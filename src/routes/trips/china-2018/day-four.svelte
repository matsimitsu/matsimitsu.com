	<p>
		After visiting "Ocean World" yesterday, we decided it was time to explore nature with a hike.
		Last year we walked the "Dragon back trail" and this time we wanted to see the "Lion Rock peak".
		It meant taking the ferry to the other side of Kowloon Bay.

		After crossing the bay, we took the MTR to the start of our hike. When we exited the subway, we
		noticed a temple, and since we hadn't seen one yet this trip, we had to check it out.

		The weather was predicted as sunny, but that turned out not to be the case. The temperature was
		great, though, at a nice 27 degrees, and without the sun and a slight breeze, it was excellent
		hiking weather.
