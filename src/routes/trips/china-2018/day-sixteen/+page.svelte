		Technically today is a travel day, but since the plane leaves at 23:55, we decided to re-visit
		the Zhangjiajie National Park (the entry card is valid for four days) to walk the Golden Whip
		Stream.

		The park has a bus system, but the different parts aren't connected. At the end of the trail, we
		were at a random exit of the park, and we could either walk the trail back or get a taxi to a
		different entrance from where we could take the free bus. A 100 Yen taxi later, we were at the
		other entrance, and luckily we weren't alone.
