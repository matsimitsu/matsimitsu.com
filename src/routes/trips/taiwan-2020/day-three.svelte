  <h2>Alishan, Chiayi</h2>
	<p>
		After an early rise and chinese breakfast I headed to the bus stop for Bus 7322 to Alishan, a
		place high up in the mountains. The bus takes between 2.5-3 hours to make it&#39;s way up the
		mountains through windy roads.

		After paying the park entrance fee I made my way to the train station to take the Alishan Forest
		Railway train to Zhaoping, a short ride away.

		And venture off I did, while walking around I noticed a trail that would take me up to a
		mountain top, which could be a great view. The trail hugged the railway line and went over very
		mountainous terrain with lots of steps. After a while I noticed people following the train
		tracks, which were nice and flat and decided to to the same.

		This made for a much faster walk :). It was around 3:30 when the clouds started rolling in. The
		last bus was at 17:10 and I was about halfway down the 2-hour trail. The starting point of the
		trail was about half an hour from the bus stop so this was cutting it close. About two-thrids to
		the top the clouds covered everything, continuing wouldn&#39;t be for the amazing views, so I
		turned around and headed back to the park entrance.

		From the park entrance it was another 2-3 hour bus ride down to Chiayi, where I had to get back
		to the hotel to get my bag that I was able to store there for the day. Luckily the hotel is near
		the train station, from where I took a 2-hour train to Kaohsiung. It was round nine in the
		evening when I arrived, time for dinner at a local night market.
