		I had no real plan for this day, it was a nice Saturday with a lot of sun. I picked a random

		During this trip I felt some range missing from my lenses. I have a 12mm lens and a 30mm lens.
		In theory great for street photography, but to get the framing I wanted I needed to move close
		and that usually caused people to look at the camera.

		Time for a new lens and after a short research session I settled on the Sigma 60mm, which
