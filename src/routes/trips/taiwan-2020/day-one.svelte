		Built in 1972, the temple has a very relaxing atmosphere, there was almost nobody there, except
		for a group of people taking an art class and a small group of women playing flutes, which made

	<p>
		From the Confusius temple to another temple, the Wan He Temple. A seven kilometer walk right
		through the center of town with plenty of things to see along the way, it&#39;s a nice anchor
		point for today&#39;s itinerary. Amongst the things to see was the old <strong
			>Taichung Broadcasting Bureau</strong

<TextContent
	><p>
		From the Wan He temple it&#39;s a short ten minute bus ride to Rainbow village, one of the more
		well known tourist locations of the city. The buses in Taichung are <strong>free</strong> for
		the first couple of kilometers, which is great! You do need a card to tap in-and-out in case you
		go further. You can get ifferent types of cards at convenient stores such as the 7-eleven. Make
		sure to get an <strong>&quot;Easy Card&quot;</strong> this will work across the country including
		the Taipei metro. Don&#39;t forget to top it up with 100 Taiwanese Dollars when you get it.

		Over time these villages became run-down and the government wanted to replace the villages with
		better housing. Mostly high-rise buildings, as the land they were on was quite valuable. You can
