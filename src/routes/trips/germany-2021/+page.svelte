		We started in a Dutch themepark, <strong>Toverland</strong> which just opened a new coaster.
	</p>
	<p>
		We then proceeded to <strong>Holiday Park</strong>, a smaller family park and then continued to
		the biggest park on the trip, <strong>Europapark</strong>. This was also the most southern point
		of the trip.
	</p>
	<p>On our way backup up we came across <strong>Tripsdrill</strong>, a former vineyard.</p>
	<p>
		Getting closer to The Netherlands, we visited <strong>Phantasialand</strong> probably the best
		themed park of the ones we visited. And finally <strong>Moviepark</strong>, before returning
		home.

	<h2>Toverland, Netherlands</h2>
	<p>
		<em>Disclaimer, this entire trip was shot with a relative crappy phonecam.</em>
		First up was Toverland, a relatively small Dutch themepark that recently expanded with a new entrance
		area and a pretty awesome coaster.

		Toverland started as a childrens playground and slowly expanded to the park it is today. With 3
		coasters, and the standard logflume/rapid river you can certainly spend at least half a day in
		the park if it isn&#39;t too busy.

	<p>
		The first coaster of the day was <strong>Expedition GeForce</strong>, an Intamin steal coaster

		in Waliby Holland, but has much better airtime.

		When planning this trip we were slightly worried about the food in the parks, from what we could
		remember it used to consist mostly of pretty bad fries and typical German staples such as
		Schnitzel. And I must say that for almost all parks we were plesantly suprised by the quality of
		the food. This burger in Europapark was delicious.

	<h2>Tripsdrill, Germany</h2>
	<p>
		After Europapark it was time for the weirdest park of the trip. The theme throughout the park is

		amusement park and is still owned and managed by the same family.

		The layout of the park is slightly confusing and there&#39;s a huge patch of grassland in the
		middle that doesn&#39;t seem to be used for anything. But the rides were really nice and the
		theming was quite good, compared to Holiday Park for example. I&#39;d definitely recommend going
		here if you are in the neighbourhood.

	<h2>Technik Museum Sinsheim</h2>
	<p>
		On our second travel day it was supposed to rain a lot and we didn&#39;t feel like exploring a
		city in the rain (KÃ¶ln), and on our way to Tripsdrill we noticed a Concorde and a Tupolev Tu-144
		perched on a rooftop. We decided to check it out.

		A nice suprise when we got to the roof was that you could access both the <em>Concorde</em> and
		it&#39;s Russian counterpart the <em>Tupolev Tu-144</em>. Compared to modern aircraft both were
		very claustrofobic and I would not have enjoyed a trip in either of them.

		We couldn&#39;t believe our luck, just 2 days before we were at the park, Phantasialand

	<h2>Moviepark, Germany</h2>
	<p>
		On our final day we visited Moviepark Germany, dueue to Covid, there weren&#39;t a lot of people
		in the park, and we were able to do everthing before 14:00 in the afternoon. Moviepark had
		it&#39;s best days in the past and it shows, there are a lot of places that could use a lick of
		paint or general fix-ups. The restaurant staff was supposed to open one of the few places you
		could eat at noon, but they did&#39;t arrive till half an hour later, the resulting burger
		wasn&#39;t that good either.
	</p>
	<p>
		After all the amazing parks we visited in the past week it was a bit of a let-down. Word is
		there are new investments coming to the park, so lets hope they can give it some new life in the
		coming years.
