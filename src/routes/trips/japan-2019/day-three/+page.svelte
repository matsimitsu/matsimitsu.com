		We had to get up &quot;early&quot; and headed to the nearby 7-Eleven to get lunch we could eat
		on the mountain. From there we took multiple trains to Mt. Takao.

	<h2>Mount Takao</h2>

	<p>
		A number of trails were closed due to typhoon damage. This meant we had to take the cable-car up
		the mountain and from there we could start our hike around the mountain.

		We spent a couple of hours navigating a few trails on the mountain, hardly passing anyone on the

		What wasn&#39;t so quiet was the street in front of the Okonomiyaki place near Shinjuku station.
		The food was really good though!
