		There was also this russian-made coaster that required at least 3 people per car, otherwise it
		wouldn't make it to the lift-hill. Luckily for us one of the operators was so kind to accompany
		us, so we could ride the coaster.

		All the rides to make it a great park are there, you have your log-flume, river rapids, a nice
		coaster and lots of smaller rides for kids. I'm curious to see how this park will develop over
		the years.

		After spending a couple of hours (and many rides on Lech coaster) in the park, we headed for the
		exit.

	<p>
		There was a cable-car running through the park, but it actually starts outside and goes along
		the huge park surrounding Legendia.

		The alarm went off at 03:40 this morning, and after just barely two hours of sleep we pulled

	<p>Two uneventful flights later we were back in Amsterdam, where I took the train home.</p>
