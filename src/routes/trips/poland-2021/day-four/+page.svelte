		Because of Corona you can't wander around yourself and you have to take a tour that lasts for
		3.5 hours. Something we didn't really look forward too (we're more the wandering around types),
		but in hindsight it was a good choice as the tour guide explaned a lot more than was written on
		the signs throughout the area.

		Where camp one was mainly for prisoners to be put to work, the second camp was for systematic
		extermination and the conditions there were even worse.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main part consisted of poorly made wooden barracks that offered little protection agains the
		elements. And you were lucky if you get to live in those, because that means you made it through
		the first selection that happened at this platform in the photo below.
	</p>
	<p>Anyone not considered fit to work by a doctor would be directed to the gas chambers.</p>

		After this quite depressing morning we headed to the train station to get a train to Katowice,
		which took a good hour.

	<p>After quick freshen-up in the hotel we headed out for dinner and then to bed.</p>
