		Having explored almost every inch of Chaing Mai, it's time to head back to Bangkok. Mostly

	<p>
		With the blistering heat every day, I was looking for more and more indoor activities to do. Art
		galleries are an excellent way to get out of the heat, while still getting inspiration and
		things to see.

	<h2>Last day in Bangkok</h2>
	<p>
		After working for a few days more, it's the last day in Bangkok. A blistering Sunday where the
		first "mission" of the day was to find a locker to store my bag, as I already checked out of the
		hotel.
	</p>
	<p>
		This did not go as planned, as the online service I used to book a locker beforehand, managed to
		do that a location that did no longer exist, so I had to lug my heavy bag half-way across the
		city to a coin locker in the 36-degree heat. Fun times!
	</p>

	<h2>Back-alleys</h2>
	<p>
		People who have traveled with me know I'm a sucker for back-alleys, it's where life happens.
		Eespecially in Asia, where homes are open to the street and everything is not locked behind
		front doors and closed curtains (though that's chaging rapidly with all the new apartment
		complexes).

	<h2>Art Galleries (part two)</h2>
	<p>
		Most of these photos were taken in Talat Noi, an area on the Menam river and I was planning to
		head to the dock for a water taxi a bit up the river to Chinatown.
	</p>
	<p>
		While looking for the dock I wanted to get some bubble tea and entered what I thought was a
		shopping mall, but it turned out to be a 3-storey venue with art galleries and little shops with
		design furniture and knick-knacks.

		The day ended with a 2-hour metro trip to the domestic airport of Don Muang, where I have an
