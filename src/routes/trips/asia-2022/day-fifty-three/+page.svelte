		After an exhausting day yesterday with over 30.000 steps and little sleep, it was time to wake
		up at four in the morning to catch the 06:30 flight from Don Mueang Airport, Thailand's
		"domestic" airport.
	</p>
	<p>
		Luckily the hotel was just across the highway from the airport, and a short walk across a walk
		bridge, I was in the terminal, where most shops were still closed.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a quick check-in (everything is automated, including the bag drop, something western
		airports can learn from), and an even speedier security check, it was time to get some
		much-needed coffee and board the plane to the 3rd country of this trip; Malaysia.
	</p>
	<p>
		The flight didn't take long, and after an hour-long bus ride, I was at my hotel, where I took a
		shower and got ready to explore George Town.

		>, a combination of ingredients that should taste awful when combined, but is in fact delicious.

		Cendol is a combination of shaved ice, green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar
		syrop. In this case additional toppings included corn and sweetened red azuki beans.
