		Despite its name, Bryce Canyon is not a canyon, but an amphitheater. This because it wasn&#39;t
		caused by a stream, but by water flowing into the... theater. Speaking of flowing into the
		theater, we took a hiking path down the canyon and did a loop around.

		The 30+ degrees heat was nice at first, but at the bottom of the canyon without wind it was a
		good thing we brought lots of water.

		The trail winds through the bottom of the canyon and eventually takes you up to some amazing
		viewpoints. The floor is covered in a very fine dust that will ruin your shoes and cover your
		legs.
